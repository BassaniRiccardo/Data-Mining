In this assignment, Classification Trees, Bagging, and Random Forest are implemented and compared.

- tree.py contains clean code with the algorithm implementation
- classifiers_evaluation_raw.py contains extra code for the algorithms' evaluation
- single_tree, bagging_trees, and rf_trees contain serialized classifiers
- the *docs* folder contains the assignments's deliverables, the reference paper, and the report comparing the algorithms
